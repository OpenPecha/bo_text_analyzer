to satisfy their appetites.[5]
While even openly admitting, "We are without shame."
eXtraordinary, these uncouth Khampas—have you seen them?
Yearning to slaughter goats, sheep, oxen and other beasts,
Zooming over passes, through rivers and ravines to ransack villages—
Ah, just look at them, these meat-eating, alcohol-guzzling womanizers!
Have you seen them, these plunderers of the teachings in this world?
Such fatally absurd and egregious ways constitute a form of
Study, contemplation and meditation for our Khampa brethren!
These verses based on the thirty letters of the alphabet
I affixed at the crossroads when driven from my residence.
Ngakgi Wangpo of Samye composed this at Sangphu Neuthog. May it become a cause for virtue and excellence to abound!
