arisen land of the ḍākinīs.
In the Great Cool Grove[4] strewn with corpses,
[The vidyādharas] gathered, and when it came time to discipline beings,
The Heruka, abiding in the Unsurpassed Realm,
Placed the eloquently written tantras of the entire assembly of Bliss-Gone Ones
In the Śaṅkarakūṭa caitya.
The Great Karmendrāṇī extracted them
And entrusted them to the eight vidyādharas.
To Vimalamitra,
Born in the country of Zahor,
She entrusted the casket of Supreme Heruka-Amṛtakuṇḍalin.
To Mañjuśrīmitra,
Born in Malaya as the son of a Brahmin,
She entrusted the casket of Supreme Body—Mañjuśrī.
To the brilliant Nāgārjuna,
Born in Vedalī[5] in brahmin family,
She entrusted the casket of Supreme Speech—Padma.
To Hūṃkāra,
Born on the forested isle of Singhala,
She entrusted the casket of Supreme Mind—Yangdak.
To Prabhahasti,
Born in the country of Uḍḍiyāna, the land of the turbaned ones,
She entrusted the casket of enlightened activity—Kīla.
To Dhanasaṃskṛta,
Born in the country of Tokhar
