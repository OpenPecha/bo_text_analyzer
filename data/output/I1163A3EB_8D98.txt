ech pervade a thousand realms,
And the expressions of your bliss-empty awareness move saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
Wondrous deities of magnetizing activity,
Fervently I pray to you: consider me with your love.
Through the great blessing of basic freedom, pure and equal,
May my three doors be spontaneously perfected as the three vajras,
And the whole of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa enter the sphere of great bliss.
Grant me supreme and ordinary siddhis for magnetizing appearance and existence, I pray.
