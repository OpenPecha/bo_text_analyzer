hereafter, three great councils were convened
And seven great patriarchs appeared in succession.
In short, all the teachings and holders of the teachings
In India, China, Nepal, Tibet and elsewhere
Arose through your compassionate blessings, Lord of Sages,
And whatever is still to come will arise through your power.
Repeatedly remembering this, your kindness, I offer homage!
Thus, to the peerless teacher, who is the Buddha,
The great Dharma, which protects and pacifies,
And the precious Saṅgha, most excellent of guides,
I pray, with unshakeable and heartfelt devotion!
With renunciation, discipline and bodhicitta,
May I directly realize the perfect view,
Complete all ten stages and five paths,
And become one with you, King of the Śākyas!
Thus, while on pilgrimage in the noble land of India, Tsuklak Lungrik Nyima was inspired to make this simple prayer. Grant your blessings, I pray, so that it may be fulfilled!
